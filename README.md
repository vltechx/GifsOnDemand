# GifsOnDemand


A Web Application developed to learn basic web application development on static site. This provides ability to schedule and manage an automated GIF gallery. A user logs into the site, enters a subject and a refresh frequency and the gallery will be automatically populated by the GIFs related to the image at the specified refresh rate.

## Learning involves:
- Implementing a rudimentary registration and login process
- Integrating with external APIs or libraries
- Implementing a scheduling mechanism
- Some UI development
